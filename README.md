# Caddy Proxy

Creates a reverse proxy based on Docker container labels.

## Getting started

Download and execute the setup scriptâ€¦ 

```
$ curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toby-griffiths/caddy-docker-proxy/main/setup | sh
```

See script output for details of how to label your containers for proxying.

Profit!

Personally I have this setup aliased to a useful command, since I can run it
over & over again, and it outputs the basic label use, the reference links and
the command for killing the proxy.
